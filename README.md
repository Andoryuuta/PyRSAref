# PyRSAref

A pybind11 wrapper for a very small subset of [rsaref2.0](https://sourceforge.net/projects/rsaref/) features.

This code is specific to, and **only** used for, communication with an old proprietary game server.

**THIS WILL NOT WORK FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE.**

**DO NOT USE THIS FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN REFERENCE!**

## License note
Everything in the `PyRSAref/rsaref` folder is from the RSA reference implementation (slightly modified to not use K&R function declarations and macros).

The RSA reference implementation has it's own license terms in `PyRSAref/rsaref/LICENSE.US`.
